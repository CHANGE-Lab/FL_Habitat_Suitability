# Habitat suitability modeling to inform seascape connectivity conservation and management 

What spatial patterns and environmental conditions drive the distribution of suitable habitat for sub-adult bluestriped grunt and gray snapper? How do these factors influence the ontogenetic migrations of sub-adult bluestriped grunt and gray snapper across the mangrove-seagrass-reef seascape of the Florida Keys, USA? What does this mean for ecological connectivity and the spatial design of coastal conservation and habitat restoration efforts? We address these questions using species- and life stage-specific spatial models of habitat suitability constructed via two methods: penalized logistic regression and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt).
